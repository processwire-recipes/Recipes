title: Extending page save process

----

version: 1.0.0

----

authors: lostkobrakai

----

tags: pages, modules, helpers, autoload

----

problem:
You need to run any process after saving pages.

----

solution:
The best way to add those extra process(es) is via a small autoload module. This can be placed in `/site/modules/HookAfterPagesSave/HookAfterPagesSave.module`. Now you can manage and extend this like every other module as well. You can change the things to be changed in the afterSaveReady() method, add module settings to give easy access to potential user manageable settings. Also you can easily enable/disable this at any time. 

Keep in mind, that modules can't use the api variables ($pages, $user, â€¦), like you can use them in templates. You can either use `$this->pages` or `wire('pages')`.

    public function init() {
        // init() is called when the module is loaded.
        // saveReady is a hook after processing the previous changes of the page,
        // but just before those changes are saved to the database.
        // It's called for each page that's being saved, no matter if it's in
        // the backend or in your templates via the api.
        $this->addHookAfter('Pages::saveReady', $this, 'afterSaveReady'); 
    }

    public function afterSaveReady($event) {
        // Get the soon to be saved page object from the given event
        $page = $event->arguments[0]; 

        // Sample condition and changes
        if($page->template == "basic-page"){
            $page->addStatus(Page::statusLocked);
            // Page will be saved right after this hook, so no need to call save().
            // Every other page you load and edit here needs to be saved manually.
            $this->message("Page has been locked");
        }
    }
